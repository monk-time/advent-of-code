# advent-of-code
My solutions in Python 3 and JavaScript (ES2015+) for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) â€” *"a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels."*

### How to run

All `.js` files should be run in Firefox/Chrome console on the puzzle's /input page.

Python solutions have inputs already downloaded into input/ folder and can be run as stand-alone files:
```bash
python year2019/aoc17.py
```

### Testing

All python solutions have tests written for Pytest, ranging from basic checks for final answers for simple puzzles to extensive coverage for more complex puzzles. Tests run on all available CPUs using `pytest-xdist`.
```bash
pytest
pytest year2018/
pytest year2019/tests/test_aoc17.py
```
