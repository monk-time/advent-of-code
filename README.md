# advent-of-code
My solutions in Python 3 and JavaScript (ES2015+) for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) â€” *"a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels."*

### How to run

All `.js` files should be run in Firefox/Chrome console on the puzzle's /input page. 

Python solutions have inputs already downloaded into input/ folder and can be run as stand-alone files:
```bash
python year2019/aoc17.py
```

Python solutions have tests written in pytest.
